				<h2>Something about Sweden...</h2>
				<p>This will be a short paragraph about the history and the traditions of Sweden.  It's not going to be too long, but it should have some detailed descriptions about midsummer and stuff like that.  I might even include a link to a website on Swedish stuff.  It should be longer than this, but I haven't been there yet.  It will detail food and important places and stuff.</p>
				<h3>My experience...</h3>
				<p>This paragraph will detail my experience while living in Sweden, but I don't want to type much more then this.  Just adding some more filler text to make it look like I'm talking about something important.  I'm really just making the paragraph longer by talking about nothing.  School just ended and I remember nothing.  I like pineapples. So on and so forth.</p>

				<h2>Something about Paris...</h2>
				<p>This will be a short paragraph about the history and the traditions of Paris.  It's not going to be too long, but it should have some detailed descriptions about traditions and stuff like that.  I might even include a link to a website on French stuff.  It should be longer than this, but I haven't been there yet.  It will detail food and important places and stuff.</p>
				<h3>My experience...</h3>
				<p>This is where I will talk about what I did and how I felt about Paris, but I haven't been there yet, so I'll stop typing.  My friend has a pet bird that was rescued after it fell out of it's nest.  Sparkles are my favorite color. And scene.</p>
